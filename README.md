# Content-Monetization

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict YouTube ad revenue using machine learning techniques. It leverages historical video data and features such as views, likes, comments, video category, and more to estimate the potential revenue a video can generate. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model building, and a Streamlit app for interactive revenue prediction.

# Features 

==> Data preprocessing and cleaning in Jupyter Notebook.

==> Multiple machine learning models for revenue prediction (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

==> Interactive Streamlit app where users can input video details to predict revenue.

==> Handles categorical features like video category and device type.

==> Displays video metadata including thumbnails for better visualization.
